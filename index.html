            <li><strong>Respectful Behavior:</strong> All players must treat others with respect and refrain from any form of harassment, discrimination, or bullying based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or other personal factors. Respectful behavior is required at all times.</li>

            <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Players are not allowed to promote or advertise external servers, websites, or products without prior approval from server staff. This applies to in-game and external promotional efforts.</li>
