    <h2>Applicant Rules</h2>
</header>

<main>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Staff Conduct:</strong> Server owners and staff members must agree to uphold the integrity of their server by refraining from abusing their privileges or mistreating players. If the server owner or staff member is found to be abusing their powers, they will receive one final warning before being permanently banned from the server.</li>

        <li><strong>Respectful Behavior:</strong> Applicants must agree to enforce respectful behavior on their server by ensuring all players treat others with respect and refrain from any form of harassment, discrimination, or bullying based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or other personal factors.</li>

        <li><strong>Cheating and Hacking:</strong> Applicants must confirm their commitment to preventing the use of cheats, hacks, or any unauthorized third-party modifications that provide players with an unfair advantage. The server owner is responsible for maintaining fair gameplay by ensuring all players follow the server's anti-cheat policies to their best ability.</li>

        <li><strong>Inappropriate Content:</strong> Applicants must ensure that players do not share or create explicit, offensive, or copyrighted content while participating on the server. This includes inappropriate player skins, usernames, and in-game chat. (We don't want Disney after us with those metal bats.)</li>

        <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Applicants must agree not to promote or advertise external servers, websites, or products without prior authorization from staff members. This includes in-game and external promotional efforts.</li>

        <li><strong>Real Money Transactions:</strong> Applicants must ensure that the trading of real money for in-game currency, items, or services is strictly regulated on their server. Unauthorized trading or selling of in-game items for real-world currency is prohibited. This rule is subject to the specific type of server and may vary, so check with staff.</li>

        <li><strong>Age Restriction:</strong> Applicants should confirm that they meet the minimum age requirement to operate a server within the network, as specified in the networkâ€™s guidelines, if applicable.</li>

        <li><strong>Modification of Terms:</strong> Applicants must acknowledge that the terms and conditions may be updated or modified as necessary, and they will be notified of any significant changes.</li>
